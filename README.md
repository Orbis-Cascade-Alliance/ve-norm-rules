# Alliance VE Norm Rules
The main folder of this repository contains the code for each Primo VE Local Display Field developed by the NRSG and distributed to Alliance institutions from the Network Zone.  It also contains any out-of-the-box (OTB) display fields that have been edited by the NRSG. Edits to OTB fields must be put in place from the member's Institution Zone, as they cannot be distributed from the Network Zone.

# Optional Code
The Optional Code directory contains code snippets that can be added to any display field rule in VE (OTB or Local Display fields) to customize what data displays in that field.  For example, one snippet shows how to include data from fields that contain $5 (denotes that the field data is specific to an institution).

# Naming conventions for files in main repository:

• Rule "section" (Display, Search, Facet) is given.

• NRSG-edited OTB display fields have the field name shown.

• NRSG-created local display fields have their number shown (e.g., lf51, lf100) and a display label (e.g., DOI, reproduction note, etc.).

Examples include:

	OTB field, edited by NRSG: Display_AddedTitles.txt

	Local display field, created by NRSG: Display_lf100_OCLCNumber.txt
